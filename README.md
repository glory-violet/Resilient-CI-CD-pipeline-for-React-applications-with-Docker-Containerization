# Resilient-CI-CD-pipeline-for-React-applications-with-Docker-Containerization
Implement a robust CI/CD pipeline for a React application, leveraging Docker for containerization, GitHub for version control, GitHub Actions for continuous integration, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for continuous deployment.


## Project Architectural Overview:
#### This section provides a high-level architectural overview of the project, outlining the key components, their interactions, and the overall structure.

## Project Execution

### Phase 1: Environment Setup on the local machine
**Step 1:** Setting up Development Environment

Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Docker
- **Step 1.1:** Install VS Code, set it up as the primary IDE.
- **Step 1.2:** Install Docker on the local machine.
- **Step 1.3:** Enhance VS Code with the Docker extension.

### Phase 2: Application Development
Step 2: Developing the React Application in Docker
Tools: Docker, React
- Substep 1: Create a new React application using VS Code.
- Substep 2: Write a Dockerfile to define the container environment.
- Substep 3: Develop the React application within the Docker container.

## Phase 3: Version Control
Step 3: Version Control with GitHub
Tools: GitHub
- Substep 1: Set up a new repository on GitHub for version control.
- Substep 2: Push the React application code to the GitHub repository.

## Phase 4: Continuous Integration
Step 4: Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions
Tools: GitHub Actions, React, Docker
- Substep 1: Configure GitHub Actions workflow in the repository.
- Substep 2: Automate tasks such as testing, linting, and Docker image building.

Step 5: Docker Image Build Automation
Tools: GitHub Actions, Docker
 - Substep 1: Automate the Docker image build process within the GitHub Actions workflow.

## Phase 5: Continuous Deployment
Step 6: Continuous Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Tools: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, GitHub Actions
- Substep 1: Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for deploying the React application.
- Substep 2: Configure GitHub Actions to trigger automatic deployments to Elastic Beanstalk upon changes to the main branch.

## Technology and Tools Used:
## DevOps Tools
### 1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code) - For Development Environment:
> #### Use VS Code as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for setting up Docker environment and developing the React application.

### 2. Docker - For Containerization 
> #### Use docker for containerizing React application on the local system.

### 3. React Application 
> #### Develop the React application using best practices and modular components within the Docker Containerization using Vs.Code.

### 4. GitHub - For Version Control
> #### Use GitHub as the version control repository for the React application code, allowing for collaboration, code review, and version tracking.

### 5. GitHub Actions - For Continous Integration
#### Configure GitHub Actions to automate CI workflows, including running tests, linting, and building the Docker image whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Docker Image Build:
Automate the build process of the Docker image for the React application using GitHub Actions.

## AWS Cloud
> ### 6. Amazon Elastic Beanstalk - For Continous Deployment
Implement GitHub Actions to automatically deploy the React application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

Elastic Beanstalk Environment:
Utilize Elastic Beanstalk as a fully managed service for deploying and scaling web applications. It simplifies the deployment process and provides a scalable infrastructure.

> ### Why use Docker?
> - Isolation and Portability
> - Ecosystem Collaboration
> - Consistent Environments
> - Rapid Deployment and Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)
> - Scalability and Resource Efficiency

> ### Docker components used in this project are:
> - **Docker File:**
  This is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. 
  It specifies the base image, dependencies, environment variables, and other configurations required to create a container image.
> - **Docker Image:**
These are read-only templates that contain everything needed to run a container.
Images are created from a set of instructions called Dockerfiles
> - **Docker Container:**
Containers are lightweight and isolated runtime environments created from Docker images. each container has an application and its dependencies, running in an isolated process. 
Create Docker containers for the React application to encapsulate the application code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.
> - **Docker Volume:**
They provide a way to share data between containers or between the host system and containers.
> - **Docker Compose:**
Define a Docker Compose configuration to orchestrate multiple containers, specifying services, networks, and volumes required for the complete application stack.

## How to Install Docker

### Step-1
#### Docker:
Docker is a platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications within lightweight, portable containers, ensuring consistency across different environments.

## Project Execution Steps: 
### Step-1 
### Setting up Docker using Vs Code
- Open Vs.Code Terminal or Install
- Install the "Docker Extention" on Vs.Code

## Conclusion:
This project setup ensures a smooth and automated workflow from development to deployment, fostering collaboration and maintaining consistency across the development and deployment phases.
